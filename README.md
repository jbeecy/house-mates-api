## About House Mates

House Mates in a forum specifically designed for finding a roommate. I am sure we all know how not fun planning a housing situation can be. The goal of this application is to make finding a roommate easier for those who need it. 

To get started, make sure to register in the sign up form then sign in. Once signed in, you will be able to create a post, show all posts, update a post of yours, and delete a post of yours if you need to. You can also change your password. Once you have created a post, you will be given a post ID, hang on to this incase you want to update or delete your post. 

Show all posts will do exactly what you expect: it will show you all posts that have not been deleted. 

Update and delete post require ownership, meaning only the user that created the post can perform those actions.

If you create a new post, click on the show all posts button to display your new post.
